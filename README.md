It can be run by command line (providing php is installed) or thrown on a lamp/wamp stack and run in browser.

If run on command line, you have optional command line arguments:
php index.php <products_file> <listings_file> <results_file>

where <products_file> is the file containing the products, <listings_file> is the file containing the listings, and <results_file> is the name of the file to output the results in.

Defaults for these arguments exist as 'products.txt', 'listings.txt', and 'results.txt'.

If run in a browser, you must make sure filename match the defaults.
